# AWS Database Deployment Assessment

## Lab Overview

In this assessment, you will deploy and secure AWS database services by launching an Amazon EC2 instance, creating a database subnet group, deploying an Amazon RDS MySQL database, and configuring secure communication between application and database resources.

## Scenario

You have joined an organization as a Cloud Engineer. The company requires a secure and highly available database environment for its applications. Your task is to deploy the required compute and database resources, configure secure access, and ensure that database connectivity follows AWS security best practices.

## Solution

To meet these requirements, you will launch an Amazon EC2 instance, create a database subnet group using private subnets, deploy an Amazon RDS MySQL database, and configure security groups to allow only authorized application servers to access the database. This approach ensures secure database access while keeping the database isolated from direct public access.

# Assessment Objectives

This lab environment is designed to evaluate your practical skills in deploying scalable and highly available web applications on AWS. As part of this assessment, you will configure load balancing, automated instance provisioning, and dynamic scaling using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and an Application Load Balancer.

You are expected to follow AWS best practices and use the specified resource names to ensure successful validation.
> **Note:** To ensure successful validation and consistency across all assessment tasks, you must deploy all AWS resources in **one of the following supported AWS Regions only**:
>
> - us-east-2 
> - us-west-2
> - us-east-1
>
> Resources deployed in any other AWS Region may not be detected by the validation scripts and could result in assessment failures.

## Task 1: Deploy an Application Load Balancer

> **Note:** Follow the specified naming conventions exactly to ensure validation works properly.

1. Create an Application Load Balancer named **Lab1-ALB**.
2. Deploy the load balancer in the public subnets created in Scenario 1.
3. Configure an HTTP listener on port **80**.

---
### Success Criteria

- An Application Load Balancer named **Lab1-ALB** exists.
- An HTTP listener is configured on port **80**.

<validation step="db4abf79-5f64-40c0-a0f2-bbd26ca6c6b7" />


## Task 2: Create and Configure a Target Group

> **Note:** Follow the specified naming conventions exactly to ensure validation works properly.

1. Create a Target Group named **Lab1-TG**.
2. Configure the target group for HTTP traffic.
3. Associate **Lab1-TG** with the listener configured on **Lab1-ALB**.

---

## Task 3: Configure an Auto Scaling Group

> **Note:** Follow the specified naming conventions exactly to ensure validation works properly.

1. Create an Auto Scaling Group named **Lab1-ASG** using **Lab1-Web-LT**.
2. Deploy Auto Scaling instances into the private subnets created in Scenario 1.
3. Register all instances with **Lab1-TG**.

---
### Success Criteria

- An Auto Scaling Group named **Lab1-ASG** exists.
- Instances are deployed in private subnets.
- Instances are registered with **Lab1-TG**.

---
<validation step="b8f83458-78bf-4c07-af9e-6dc5f25baf90" />


## Task 4: Configure Automatic Scaling and Validate Load Balancing

1. Configure **Lab1-ASG** with:
   - Minimum Capacity: **2**
   - Desired Capacity: **2**
   - Maximum Capacity: **4**

2. Create a scaling policy that triggers when average CPU utilization reaches **60% or higher**.

3. Verify that the DNS name of **Lab1-ALB** successfully returns a web page from the Apache web servers running in the Auto Scaling Group.
